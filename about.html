			I'm 28. I grew up in a small town outside of Boston. I used to live in Montreal, and still think it may be the greatest city in North America. I've been working as an R&D / quality assurance analyst for a small consumer electronics company for the last 3 years. However, it's time for me to move on and pursue something i'm more excited about:<br>
			the internet!

			<ul>I have a deep, enduring love for:<br>
				<li>Cool dogs</li>
				<li>Kate Bush</li>
				<li>Donuts</li>
				<li>Law & Order</li>
				<li>Schadenfreude</li>
			</ul>
